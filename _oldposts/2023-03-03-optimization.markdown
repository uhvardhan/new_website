Developed a continuum mechanics-based leader-follower paradigm for optimal
large-scale multi-agent system (MAS) deformation using quadratic programming,
ensuring collision avoidance and minimal deviation from desired trajectory, as
demonstrated with 67 quadcopters tracking a helix trajectory in 3D motion space.
