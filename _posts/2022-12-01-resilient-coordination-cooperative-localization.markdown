A fault-resilient multi-UAS coordination approach using continuum mechanics
principles to ensure safety and manage transitions between Homogeneous
Deformation Mode and Fault Resilient Mode. The approach utilizes Cooperative
Localization for detecting failed UAS and localizing healthy ones at a low
computational cost, and has been validated through simulations with various
failure scenarios.
