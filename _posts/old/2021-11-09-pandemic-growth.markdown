A novel physics-based data-driven approach for modeling and predicting the
spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, utilizing spatial and
temporal conservation laws. The prediction model demonstrated high accuracy,
with relative estimation errors below 1\% for the number of cases, deaths, and
recoveries, between March 12, 2020 and October 1, 2021. Furthermore, our
results aligned with the observed growth of the pandemic, considering the
impact of the delta variant and the emergence of new waves of infections.
