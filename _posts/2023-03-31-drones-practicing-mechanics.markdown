Introduced a novel approach for visualizing linear deformation and strain
analysis in 2D and 3D motion spaces using quadrotors as particles of a
deformable body, providing a practical method for teaching mechanics concepts
and ensuring inter-agent collision avoidance through lower bounds on axial
strains in continuum deformation coordination.
