A continuous-time optimal control approach for modeling and controlling traffic
congestion in a network of interconnected roads using the street map of Phoenix
City. The proposed model utilizes mass-flow conservation law, stochastic
processes, and boundary control, with constraints ensuring feasibility and
traffic backflow avoidance. The approach demonstrates stability in simulation
studies, and future work will explore modeling and controlling traffic
congestion as a Markov Decision Process.
